# USER.md - About You

_So Asta can help you better. This is the single place for who you are; Asta uses it for context, time/weather, and reminders._

- **Name:**
- **What to call you:** Tokyo
- **Location:** _Holon, Israel_
- **Timezone:** _(optional)_
- **Notes:**

## Context

_(Projects, preferences, things that matter. Asta uses this when answering.)_

---

The more you put here, the better Asta can adapt — without leaking this outside your workspace.

## Notes & Saving Conventions

When saving notes, memos, or lists, follow these rules. Three systems are available:

### Notion (preferred for structured / long-form content)
Notion API is configured. Use for anything Tokyo wants accessible on all devices with search.
- **Meeting notes** (from audio or conversation) → Notion (see TOOLS.md for page IDs)
- **Research / summaries** → Notion
- **Project notes** → Notion
- Append blocks to the relevant parent page defined in TOOLS.md.

### Apple Notes (iCloud — quick phone access)
Use for short, on-the-go items. Create via the apple-notes skill.
- **Shopping lists** → Apple Notes, folder "Shopping"
- **Quick todos / reminders-as-notes** → Apple Notes, folder "Notes"
- **Anything Tokyo explicitly wants on phone fast** → Apple Notes

### Workspace files (local)
Use for project artifacts, exports, and research docs only (not personal notes/lists).

### Default behaviour
- Any notes request → Apple Notes, no clarification question.
- Any list request (shopping/grocery/general list) → Apple Notes, no clarification question.
- Meeting notes → Notion by default.
- Research / summaries → Notion by default.
