# TOOLS.md - Your Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What goes here

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Example

```markdown
### SSH
- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "Nova"
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

Add whatever helps. Asta reads this at context build.
